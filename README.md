This simple chrome extension is meant to notify you if resource you're currently interested in comes back online. Just paste url in the input and wait for notification from Chrome.

!Due to migration from Manifest V2 to V3 the background running option is now unaccessible, if you want to use it, please keep it open in separate Chrome window (duh)

I you stumble upon this please enjoy, it's just a fun little project of mine, done when my company's Git went down (for like a day..)
